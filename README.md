# Sortable List

Display a scrambled list that can be sorted with drag and drop

- Create an ordered list (Top 10 richest people)
- Scramble list items randomly
- Allow user to drag and drop an item to a different position
- Button to check if items are in correct order
- Show green for correct order and red for wrong order
